# Missing middle upzoning 

As detailed in _[Melbourne's Missing Middle](https://yimbymelbourne.org.au/missing-middle)_, broad upzoning is the best, most equitable approach to creating housing abundance for all. Our proposed city-wide upzoning is focused around Melbourne's extensive train and tram networks, with the goal of enabling more people to utilise our city's existing infrastructure, and to live in the places that enable them to experience the best Melbourne has to offer. 


## How zoning will change

We have taken existing zoning controls, and upzoned accordingly:

1. All lots within lower-density residential zones (including Neighbourhood Residential Zone (NRZ) and General Residential Zone (GRZ)) within 500m of a tram stop or 1km of a train station are rezoned to the six-storey Missing Middle Zone (MMZ).
2. Any lot in a General Residential Zone not near trams or trains is rezoned RGZ, but parking minimums remain unless council states otherwise. 
3. Any lot in a Neighbourhood Residential Zone not near trams or trains is rezoned GRZ, but parking minimums remain unless council states otherwise. 

The effect of these changes will be to upzone much of Melbourne's land, allowing more homes to be built within existing communities.

## Introducing the Missing Middle Zone

The Missing Middle Zone (MMZ) will enable 6 storey buildings to be built within walking distance of every train station and tram stop in Melbourne. This zone will support the density levels that underpin great and iconic cities across the world, with beautiful street walls free of onerous setback rules, activating the streets below. 

This new zone is a refinement of the existing Residential Growth Zone (RGZ), and has been altered in four key ways. The MMZ:

* Implements a default maximum height of 21 metres or 6 storeys, an increase from the RGZ’s current 4-storey default.
* Expands non-residential land uses to include a wider range of neighbourhood  services & amenities.
* Abolish car parking minimums.
* Exempts from notice and review developments of any total value containing at least 10% public or community housing in perpetuity

MMZ areas will be entirely mixed-use, and buildings across the area will be permitted by-right to include neighbourhood services and amenities, cafes, libraries, and shops on the ground floor. Off-street parking will be allowed, but thanks to the absence of parking minimums, nobody will be forced to buy a car park that they don't need.

## Stepwise upzoning for housing diversity

Not all of Melbourne's suburbs have access to rail infrastructure but many still benefit from nearby schools, hospitals and bus routes. Local communities and businesses that aren’t as closely situated to Melbourne’s vast train and tram networks also deserve to reap the densification benefits the Missing Middle reforms will provide. 

Inspired by the success of Auckland’s zoning reforms, the Missing Middle reform will completely eliminate the Neighbourhood Residential Zone (NRZ) across metropolitan Melbourne, replacing it with General Residential Zone (GRZ). In turn, all land currently zoned GRZ will also be upzoned to the Residential Growth Zone (RGZ).

## The importance of excess zoned capacity

Under the current system, the zoned capacity of each LGA is kept only barely higher than the number of homes that need to be built. 

This has two key problems: 

1. limiting housing development, and
2. encouraging land speculation.


### Zoned capacity & housing development

In order to ensure enough housing supply is delivered to meet demand, it is important to create a significant excess of zoned capacity. It is impractical to think that every potential lot will be built to its maximum zoned capacity within a reasonable timeframe. This is because lots are heterogeneous, and development potential can be limited by any number of factors including:

* impractical size or location 
* heritage or character protections
* vital community or commercial functions
* ownership structures that make sale to developers unlikely 

In addition to the above, zoning often limits the yield of land such that it is impossible to undertake a densification development that stacks up financially. A key problem with restrictive zoning in general is that it is non-responsive to land prices, and broadly ambivalent to market realities. 


### Zoning capacity & land speculation

This leads to the second problem with limiting zoned capacity: it incentivises land speculation and landbanking. This is because large areas of restrictive zoning enables a small number of actors to feasibly gain control of the bulk of lots available and viable for development. However, if developable land is made abundantly available through broad upzoning, any and all landbanking becomes entirely infeasible. 

For all these reasons and more, a system that relies on a majority of zoned capacity being developed is not a serious system. Through broad upzoning, we can increase the likelihood that enough homes will be built across our city, and reduce landbanking. This is the best possible way to lower housing costs across our city, and enable more people to live in the places best suited to their wants and needs.
