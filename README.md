# Housing Targets Report

## Final to-do

[ ] Build clickable map in overleaf, with each region clickable, with name and annual target also present

[ ] Alter table structure and functionality:

- Annual housing target column
- Right-justify the increase
- Make sortable by column
- LGA names should link to their respective pages

[ ] Style the table @jonobri

[ ] Number the sections in the sidebar @jonobri

[ ] Carrot figures:

- Total N properties upzoned
- 4% median current value of those properties (as WGT proceeds)

[ ] Include tabs within bookdown

[ ] I think I may have deleted a very detailed table about upzoning numbers for the 01 page, and replaced it with the summary table by mistake...
